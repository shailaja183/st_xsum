Annotation Guidelines
=================

* Check if the summary exists. If not, simply go to the next instance (using the right arrow on the keyboard or right arrow on the top-left corner)

* Carefully read the article and summary

* Carefully observe hallucination spans (with black heading 'Hallucination') in the summary

* Assign Reasoning categories to various phrases WITHIN the hallucination spans by double clicking the phrase. Choose the reasoning category based on the following definition. 

Select Phrase > Double click > Choose 'Entity type'

It will automatically save your responses to the corresponding .ann file.

* For each phrase (for which you assign the reasoning category), mention how confident you are in your judgement. 

Select Phrase > Double click > Choose 'Entity attributes' > Confidence (High ↑ / Neutral ↔ / Low ↓)

* For each phrase (for which you assign the reasoning category), select whether you think is factually correct/incorrect or its facuality cannot be determined. 

Select Phrase > Double click > Choose 'Entity attributes' > Factuality (Correct ✓ / Incorrect ✕ / Unknown !)

When you double click the phrase, under 'Search' heading, you would be able to do quick Google/Wikipedia search about the phrase. Feel free to use it to verify factuality. 

* It is possible that one summary can have multiple hallucination spans and each hallucination span can have multiple reasoning categories for sub-phrases.
