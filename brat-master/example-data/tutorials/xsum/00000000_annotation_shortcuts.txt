Navigating in BRAT
================

* You can pause/resume your annotation anytime. It would be easier to open an example if you note down the id.

* At any point in time, if you think you need to edit your response, hover over the top bar showing the file name i.e. example-data/tutorials/xsum/<directory_you_are_assigned_to_annotate>, it will pull up a menu. Then press 'Collection' and choose the file you want to edit. There is also a 'Search' (by keyword) button if you do not remember the id of the example you want to edit.

* If you want to change the reasoning type, simply double-click the incorrect reasoning category over the phrase and change the type.

* If you want to change the reasoning span, double-click the current reasoning category assigned to the span, then select 'Move'. Then reselect the correct span.

* This interface is sensitive to spaces so please avoid selecting unnecessary spaces before or after the phrase.

* If you are not confident of a reasoning category, feel free to add 'Note' while you assign a reasoning type.

Keyboard Shortcuts
=================

* The following keyboard shortcuts are accessible in normal visualization or annotation state.
(When a menu is open, these keyboard shortcuts are disabled.) Note: On Mac, use Cmd instead of Ctrl.

CTRL-F: search
CTRL-G: next search result (after search)
CTRL-H: repeat the previous annotation action on the current search result (after search)
